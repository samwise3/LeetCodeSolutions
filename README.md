## Introduction

LeetCode is an essential tool for software engineers to sharpen their problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews. This repository houses my personal Java solutions to some of these problems, particularly focusing on arrays and strings. Each solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach, as well as the time and space complexity analysis.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type, with a current focus on arrays and strings:

```
.
├── Arrays
│   ├── TwoSum.java
│   ├── RemoveDuplicates.java
│   └── ...
├── Strings
│   ├── LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.java
│   └── ...
├── README.md
└── ...
```

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-interview-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-interview-solutions
   ```

2. **Navigate through folders**:  
   Browse through the `Arrays` and `Strings` folders to find solutions to specific problems.

3. **Review and run the code**:  
   Each problem file includes a Java solution that you can review and run in your preferred IDE or command line.

4. **Practice and modify**:  
   Use these solutions as a reference, and feel free to modify the code to experiment with different approaches.

## Topics Covered

This repository currently covers problems related to:

- Arrays
- Strings

More topics will be added in the future as I continue to work on additional problems.

## Languages Used

All solutions in this repository are implemented in **Java**.
